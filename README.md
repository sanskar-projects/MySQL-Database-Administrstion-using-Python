hi! this is a simple python program to perform basic DDL and DML commands on a mysql database minimising the use of structured query language (SQL) for the user, mysql.connector module is required to run this program, database name and password must be entered in the source code before compilation, editing of host name and user name may also be required in case you are not using the default values, you can refer the documentation for the last 2 points, NOTE : this program may be prone to SQL injection techniques hence careful handling is advised, thank you for reading me, now you can proceed to the sourcecode.py file.
